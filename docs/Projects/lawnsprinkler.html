                One of my favorite projects to date.
            </p>
            <p>
                Goal: <br>Design a system that could interface with the sprinkler zone system in the house,
                save a schedule, and turn sprinkler zones on/off at the proper times.
                The UI should be friendly and easy to understand,
                and the device should be reliable even when left alone for long periods of time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Materials used: <br>Arduino, Arduino IDE, LCD display, relays, keypad, timing module, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
                Challenges: <br>I ran into a couple challenges along the way. 
                One example was creating a functional and usable UI given the limitations of the display and keypad. 
                Another was properly keeping time, which lead to me adding the timing module.
            </p>
            <p>
                Result: <br>In the end, the project ended up being quite successful. 
                Testing the system went well and it was able to properly store a schedule, then run it over the course of a week. 
                The main driving factor behind the project was to replace an old system that was horrible, and I can confidently say the new one was better.
