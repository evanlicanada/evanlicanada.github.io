                Goal: <br>
                Implement a custom controller to manage the new battery management system (BMS) for the Urban concept vehicle. The BMS circuitry itself
                is being developed by other member of the team.

            <p>
                Materials used:<br>
                STM32G0, STM32CUBEIDE, Github, KiCAD, UART, I2C and more.
            </p>
            <p>
                Challenges:<br>
                While still in development, the biggest challenge I have faced so far was getting used to programming the STM32 using the STM32CUBEIDE.
                Compared to Arduino, it had quite a large learning curve. Since then I have gotten much more used to it, and I am currently working on
                ensuring compatibility with the rest of the BMS system.
