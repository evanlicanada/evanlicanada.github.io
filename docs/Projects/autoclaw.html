                The goal was to design a claw that can grab and release objects autonomously. 
                It can detect when it is close to the ground using an ultrasonic sensor, and then grab/release an object appropriately. 
                With my team we built the claw in the image using sheet metal, rivets, an Arduino, a servo motor, elastics and hopes and sleep deprivation. 
                In the end I would personally say the claw worked well, my team scored in roughly the top 30% of the year (out of ~1000 students).

            <p>
                My roles in particular was a hybrid on designing + building the claw mechanism (claw geometry, servo motor placement and control method)
                 and programming + debugging the Arduino. I also drew our teamâ€™s CAD model and engineering drawings of the claw.
                  Overall this claw was a great experience, honestly, I had a ton of fun!
