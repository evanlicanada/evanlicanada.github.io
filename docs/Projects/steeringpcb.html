                My first project after joining UBC Supermileage in September 2023. This was a fantastic introduction to PCB design.
                 The PCB itself was actually very simple â€“ it routes three key controls the driver uses through switches or buttons.
                  The start/turbo and the horn controls are push-buttons, while the emergency shutoff is a switch.
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, the PCB needed to be as large as possible to maximize the spacing between controls while still fitting in the steering handlebars
                 (they look a lot like the joystick in a fighter jet).
                  The components themselves also had to be the right size to fit in the handlebars that were designed in the past.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the end, the main difficulty was communicating with other members in the team and drivers to properly determine the
                 best set of components to use.
            </p>
            <p>   
                Lastly after everything was designed and ordered,
                 I soldered the components on, tested the connections,
                  and installed it into the two cars!
