    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <hr>

    <p>Hi! I’m Evan, a second year Engineering Physics Student at the University of British Columbia. 
        I love working on electronics design projects such as Arduinos or STM32s, and I also have a great time in Software projects! 
        While we haven’t specialized yet, I’m definitely leaning towards an electrical or software background.</p>

    <p>Following that, here’s just some miscellaneous information about me! Outside of school I really enjoy skiing, swimming and fencing (the sport). 
        Living in Alberta for most of my life also meant I spent a ton of time in the Rocky Mountains, where I camped, hikes, toured and of course, skied!</p>
